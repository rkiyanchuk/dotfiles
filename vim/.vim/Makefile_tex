# This Makefile is designed to compile latex documents using latex or pdflatex.
# So far it supports bibliography processing via bibtex (.bib file or a simlink
# should be located in the same directory from where `make` is called). The
# recompilation is done automatically until all references are resolved (.log
# file checked for corresponding warnings). Bash and Make syntax is very ugly
# but this solution is the most straightforward and portable AFAIK.
# Executing `make tarball` creates an archive that contains tex sources, bibtex
# database files, custom styles and graphics (in graphics folder). For my own
# comfort the Makefile is set up to copy my custom styles into the tarball if
# any of them is used in tex document (check is done by grepping the .tex file).
# This Makefile is designed to suit my own needs, but I hope it may be useful
# for somebody else. If you make any improvements to this Makefile I would
# appreciate notifying me of those changes -- it's very likely they will be
# useful for me as well.
